                    APPROXIMATELY 1,300 KM (810 MI) NORTHEAST FROM HOKKAIDO, 
                    JAPAN, TO KAMCHATKA, RUSSIA, SEPARATING THE SEA OF OKHOTSK

                <p>
                    All the islands are currently under Russian jurisdiction Japan claims the two 
                    southemmost large islands (Iturup and Kunashir) as part of its territory, as well as 
                    Shikotan and the Habomai islets, which has led to the ongoing Kuril Islands dispute. 
                    The disputed islands are known in Japan as the country's "Nothern Territories"

                    The Kuril Islands from part of the ring of tectonic instability encircling the Pacific 
                    Ocnean referred to as the Ring of Fire. The islands themselves are summits of 
                    stratovolcanoes that are a direct result of the subduction of the Pacific Plate under 
                    the Okhotsk Plate, which forms the Kuril Trench some 200 kilometres (120 mi) east of 
                    the islands. The chain has around 100 volcances, some 40 of which are active, and 
                    many hot springs and fumaroles.

                    Those inhabitants however, though they've quite a bit to be 
                    disgruntled about, are exceptionally good-natured. Perhaps it 
                    comes from having to get along and help one another in this harsh 
                    environment.
